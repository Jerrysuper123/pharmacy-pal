## Summary

Value proposition

Special consideration

E-pharmacy has been on the rise in Singapore. As such, we would provide a curated list of Health Sciences Authority (HSA) registered online pharmacies. This is to serve as a one-stop portal of legal e-pharmacies to guide the users to right phamacies,as the [rise of illegal/fake online pharmacies](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/the-rise-of-illegal-online-pharmacies) poses risks to the uninformed.

Project Context

Organization goals

User goals

Unique-selling point

## 1. Strategy
this section mainly discusses what???

### target market

This app is designed to target people who want to:

- find locations of registered pharmacies
- acquire information on the over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and pharmacists before making physical visits

Our target groups could be further divided:

1. basic users

Those who only want to find nearby drugstore.

- aged 18 to 50
- adequate IT literacy

2. super users
   Those who wants to get information on OTC drugs, pharmacist background, and e-pharmacy (see special consideration below)

- aged 18 to 40
- high IT literacy
- poly/degree holders and above

### Needs and pain points

- COVID-19 has strained Singapore's hospital system. For many citizens, self-care through pharmacy store has become more viable, especially for the fear of virus infection at hot spots - clinics and hospitals.

- Google allows for pharmacy location search but its search return also includes non-pharmacy results. So this app provide geo location of registered pharmacy with the Singapore government.

- With many people visiting pharmacy, some might already know what drug they want to purchase, but not sure it could be purchased over the counter.

- Some people might prefer e-pharmacy to get the drugs to deliver to their door step. However, there are many illegal online pharmacies, which might cause misuse of drugs or overdose. They need a list of HSA registered e-pharmacy.

- In addition, some people might want to know the registered pharmacist at certain drug store and also to know their experience before consulting them

### User Story

Basic users:

- As I user who works from home, I want to get to nearby pharmacy to get drugs instead of going to clinics or hospitals.

- As a user, I want to search for pharmacy in different areas, so that I could make recommendations to my my parents.

Super users:

- As a user, I know what drugs need, but I am not sure if it can be purchased over the counter (OTC) , I want to check if the drug is OTC or prescription-based, in addition to a brief description of the drug.

- As a user, I also want to know the name of the registered pharmacist, because I want to get a brief consultation from him/her, instead of ramdom picking up drugs myself.

- As a user, I might not want to travel far, so I want to get pharmacist consultation online and get the drugs delivered to home (e-phaemacy).

![icon]()

![Color](./READMESources/color.png)

The app should adopt warm color - gives uses some hope, especially for those who are ill.

The app will also adopt a more offcial them, not too fancy color or front.

Font

![font](https://elementor.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,w=720/marketing/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/4-Archivo-Black_Roboto.png)

Archivo Black & Roboto
Here we have a pairing of two sans serif fonts. Archivo Black is a grotesque sans serif, which makes it feel slightly imperfect compared to the neo-grotesque and geometric styling of Roboto.

This is a great example of how to use fonts in concord with one another. Yes, theyâ€™re two sans serifs, but the imperfect/perfect pairing of their character sets creates a good balance. This would work really well in giving an ecommerce site a youthful and trustworthy vibe.
