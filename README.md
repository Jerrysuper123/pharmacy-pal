## Summary

Value proposition

Special consideration

E-pharmacy has been on the rise in Singapore. As such, we would provide a curated list of Health Sciences Authority (HSA) registered online pharmacies. This is to serve as a one-stop portal of legal e-pharmacies to guide the users to right phamacies,as the [rise of illegal/fake online pharmacies](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/the-rise-of-illegal-online-pharmacies) poses risks to the uninformed.

Project Context

Organization goals

User goals

Unique-selling point

## 1. Strategy
this section mainly discusses what???

### target market

This app is designed to target people who want to:

- find locations of registered pharmacies
- acquire information on the over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and pharmacists before making physical visits

Our target groups could be further divided:

1. basic users

Those who only want to find nearby drugstore.

- aged 18 to 50
- adequate IT literacy

2. super users
   Those who wants to get information on OTC drugs, pharmacist background, and e-pharmacy (see special consideration below)

- aged 18 to 40
- high IT literacy
- poly/degree holders and above

### Needs and pain points

- COVID-19 has strained Singapore's hospital system. For many citizens, self-care through pharmacy store has become more viable, especially for the fear of virus infection at hot spots - clinics and hospitals.

- Google allows for pharmacy location search but its search return also includes non-pharmacy results. So this app provide geo location of registered pharmacy with the Singapore government.

- With many people visiting pharmacy, some might already know what drug they want to purchase, but not sure it could be purchased over the counter.

- Some people might prefer e-pharmacy to get the drugs to deliver to their door step. However, there are many illegal online pharmacies, which might cause misuse of drugs or overdose. They need a list of HSA registered e-pharmacy.

- In addition, some people might want to know the registered pharmacist at certain drug store and also to know their experience before consulting them

### User Story

Basic users:

- As I user who works from home, I want to get to nearby pharmacy to get drugs instead of going to clinics or hospitals.

- As a user, I want to search for pharmacy in different areas, so that I could make recommendations to my my parents.

Super users:

- As a user, I know what drugs need, but I am not sure if it can be purchased over the counter (OTC) , I want to check if the drug is OTC or prescription-based, in addition to a brief description of the drug.

- As a user, I also want to know the name of the registered pharmacist, because I want to get a brief consultation from him/her, instead of ramdom picking up drugs myself.

- As a user, I might not want to travel far, so I want to get pharmacist consultation online and get the drugs delivered to home (e-phaemacy).

### Features based on user story

breifly describe features




## 2. Scope

****** functional specification
*** content - data set (mentioned in credit)
*** Non-functional
Mobile responsive & fast performance
****

Nearby pharmacy store
Search pharmacy store
Search pharmacy drugs
See a list of HSA registered e-pharmacy

At desk, the 3 buttons should appear on top.
In mobile modes, the 3 buttons should appear below like wechat style.

/ask users for access control in current location
//find nearest pharmacy (Djastra algorithm) and check if the drug is OTC/prescription
//tell them who is the license pharmacist in charge
//remind them to bring NRIC to get pharmacy drugs (bring nric to see pharmacist)

When to use/ mobile responsive
at home, or ont he walk towards pharmacy
computer and mobile consideration

when walking map should include less buttons or feature to distract people.

Main content


## 3. Structure

Adopt a tree information structure, centre on the map itself
site map

Briefly describe the structure ****

![site map](./READMESources/siteMap.jpeg)

## 4. Skeleton
Access the wireframes for mobile, tablet, and laptop display for the website here.****

![wireframe](./READMESources/wireframe.png)

most important is map to make it the background

second most important search features

last is search drugs and e-pharmacy

## 5. Surface - visual design
### Colors
As this is a medical app, we have chosen colors resembling hospital or medical theme below.
![Color](./READMESources/color.png)

Using the above color wheel, we have set the colors in the _constant.scss file to be global variables, to be used consistently through the application.
- ColorPrimary is used the mostly throughout the app, including the app logo design, most of the icons used, and the theme of the displayed charts (See below)
- ColorAccentThree is mostly used as the background color e.g. the drug advisor page background color.
- The rest of the colors are also widely used, but mostly as supporting hues.
```
/* color setting */
$colorPrimary: #ab5e69;
$colorSecondary: #c2fbcd;
$colorAccentOne: #F7c1c9;
$colorAccentTwo: #E0ffe7;
$colorAccentThree: #8fb095;
```

PrimaryColor consistency

### Font

Font pair - Lora and Roboto 

Although theyâ€™re two sans serifs, but the imperfect/perfect pairing of their character sets creates a good balance. This would work really well in giving a youthful and trustworthy vibe.

![font](https://elementor.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,w=720/marketing/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/4-Archivo-Black_Roboto.png)

Against, in the _constant.scss file, we have set below font variables to be used consistently.
```
/* font family and size setting */
$headerFront: 'Lora', serif;
$bodyTextFront: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
```

## 6. technology stack
### Stack used:

| Tech  | Usage |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript, Bootstrap 5  | Build the main frame of the website  |
| SASS  | Organize and structure css  |
| [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)  | Call APIs  |
| [Apexcharts](https://apexcharts.com/)  | Plot charts of drug side effects reported  |
| [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)  | Create map and markers  |
| [Leaflet routing machine](https://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/)  | Draw routes on the map |
| Fontawesome  | Place icons throughout the site  |


### Algorithm used:
| Algorithm  | Usage |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Check if an array is a subset of another array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-whether-an-array-is-subset-of-another-array-set-1/)  | Match symptoms selected to disease types  |
| Linear algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between two nodes  | Display nearest pharmacy to user, but time complexity could be improved |

## 7. testing
Click [here]() for the detailed test list.

## 8. deployment
The deployment is done through Github with the instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/TylerFisher/6127328).

## 9. Limitations and future implementations
- [Use passive event listener](https://web.dev/uses-passive-event-listeners/) - not implemented currently, but could significantly improve the mobile scrolling experience especally on a map

- Leeflet Routing Machine is an open-source project, not suitable for production use. Its server could be stopped without prior notice. To commercialize this project, we might consider paid services.

- The disease and symptom dataset is rather small - less than 50 disease types currently. To improve the predictive accuracy, we might need a larger dataset or implement a back-end server to collect users' info.
