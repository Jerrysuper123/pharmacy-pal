## Summary

### Project Context
Covid19 has strained Singapore's medical system. To avoid infection hotspots (i.e. clinics or hospitals), many netizens seek help from pharmacies when falling ill. When Googling for nearby pharmacies, the search results might not always be accurate, with clinics and hospitals mixing in.

In addition, many also started using online sources to do their own symptom diagnosis, at times purchasing drugs on their own. This has paved way for the rising of [illegal online pharmacies](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/the-rise-of-illegal-online-pharmacies) in Singapore, definitely a cause for concern.

### value proposition
Pharmacy-pal is designed to aid "self-care through pharmacy" in the midst of Covid19. Not only does the it gives the direction for the nearby pharmcy in addition to registered pharmacist info, it also helps you on symptom diagnosis & medication recommendation.

## 1. Strategy
This section mainly discusses: 
- Creator's objective and users' needs match-fit
- Users' pain points and app features designed to resolve them

### Objective
This app is designed to help people who want to:

- Find locations of registered pharmacies, along with pharmacist info
- Do symptom diagnosis and medication search-up

### target market

Our target groups could be divided into:

1. basic users

Those who only want to find nearby drugstore.

- aged 18 to 50
- adequate IT literacy

2. super users
   Those who wants to get information on pharmacist background, and require symptom diagnosis and medication recommendation.

- aged 18 to 40
- high IT literacy
- poly/degree holders and above

### Needs and pain points

- For many citizens, self-care through pharmacy store has become more viable in the midst of Covid19, especially for the fear of virus infection at hot spots - clinics and hospitals.

- Google allows for pharmacy location search but its search return also includes non-pharmacy results. So this app provides geolocation of registered pharmacy under the Singapore government.

- With many people visiting pharmacy, some might require symptom diagnosis and medication recommendation before meeting the pharmacist for a more fruitful discussion.

- In addition, there is a need to know the registered pharmacist serving in drug store and also to know their experience before consulting them

### User Story

Basic users:

- As I user who works from home, I want to get to nearby pharmacy to get drugs instead of going to clinics or hospitals.

- As a user, I want to search for pharmacies in different areas, so that I could make recommendations to my parents.

Super users:

- As a user, I want to do a simple diganosis on my symptoms before visting the pharmacy, so that I could have a more fruitful discussion with the pharmacist.

- As a user, I want to know some background info of the pharmacist, so that I could get some recommendations over the counter.

- As a user, I want to search for some medications for my conditions, so that I could understand more about drugs that might be suitable for me.

- As a user, I want to search for the side effects of drugs, so that I could have a peace of mind when pharmacists prescibe the medications.

### Features based on user story

1. Display the route from user's location to the nearest pharmacy
2. Provide pharmacists' names based on locations
3. Offer symptom diagnosis and description of possible conditions
4. Recommend possible medications for the users' conditions
5. Display the drug side effects statistics to users

## 2. Scope
### Functional specification
It would be based on the aforementioned features.

### Content
The main content comes from the following sources:
- Pharmacy location and pharmacist name displayed on the map
- Display appropriate diseases matched to symptoms
- Display appropriate drugs matched to diseases
- Display charts of drug side effects trend

For more details on info content, refer to the credits section below for the list of datasources used.

### Non-functional
- The app should be mobile responsive, as users might bring their phone to search for pharmacy location.
- When in mobile format, the screen should have less buttons to prevent accidental press.

## 3. Structure
Adopt a tree information structure, with the map as the home page.

## 4. Skeleton

## 5. Surface - visual design
### Colors
As this is a medical app, we have chosen colors resembling hospital or medical theme below.
![Color](./READMESources/color.png)

Using the above color wheel, we have set the colors in the _constant.scss file to be global variables, to be used consistently through the application.
- ColorPrimary is used the mostly throughout the app, including the app logo design, most of the icons used, and the theme of the displayed charts (See below)
- ColorAccentThree is mostly used as the background color e.g. the drug advisor page background color.
- The rest of the colors are also widely used, but mostly as supporting hues.
```
/* color setting */
$colorPrimary: #ab5e69;
$colorSecondary: #c2fbcd;
$colorAccentOne: #F7c1c9;
$colorAccentTwo: #E0ffe7;
$colorAccentThree: #8fb095;
```

PrimaryColor consistency

### Font pair - Lora and Roboto 

Although theyâ€™re two sans serifs, but the imperfect/perfect pairing of their character sets creates a good balance. This would work really well in giving a youthful and trustworthy vibe.

![font](https://elementor.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,w=720/marketing/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/4-Archivo-Black_Roboto.png)

Against, in the _constant.scss file, we have set below font variables to be used consistently.
```
/* font family and size setting */
$headerFront: 'Lora', serif;
$bodyTextFront: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
```

## 6. technology stack
### Stack used:

| Tech  | Usage |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript, Bootstrap 5  | Build the main frame of the website  |
| SASS  | Organize and structure css  |
| [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)  | Call APIs  |
| [Apexcharts](https://apexcharts.com/)  | Plot charts of drug side effects reported  |
| [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)  | Create map and markers  |
| [Leaflet routing machine](https://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/)  | Draw routes on the map |
| Fontawesome  | Place icons throughout the site  |


### Algorithm used:
| Algorithm  | Usage |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Check if an array is a subset of another array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-whether-an-array-is-subset-of-another-array-set-1/)  | Match symptoms selected to disease types  |
| Linear algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between two nodes  | Display nearest pharmacy to user, but time complexity could be improved |

## 7. testing
Click [here](https://github.com/Jerrysuper123/pharmacy-pal/blob/main/READMESources/testCases.pdf) for the detailed test list.

## 8. deployment
The deployment is done through Github with the instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/TylerFisher/6127328).

## 9. Limitations and future implementations
- [Use passive event listener](https://web.dev/uses-passive-event-listeners/) - not implemented currently, but could significantly improve the mobile scrolling experience especally on a map

- Leeflet Routing Machine is an open-source project, not suitable for production use. Its server could be stopped without prior notice. To commercialize this project, we might consider paid services.

- The disease and symptom dataset is rather small - less than 50 disease types currently. To improve the predictive accuracy, we might need a larger dataset or implement a back-end server to collect users' info.
